# wiki |

MCP server that maintains a persistent Obsidian-vault knowledge base.

Instead of answering from memory or re-reading the same files, you ingest once and query forever. Instead of searching across flat notes, you traverse a typed knowledge graph — thoughts, entities, reasons, questions, conclusions — all auto-classified by topic via OpenAI embeddings.

## 💡 Why

Every time an AI answers a question, it starts from scratch — re-reading files, re-summarizing context, re-deriving the same conclusions. This wastes tokens and loses compounding knowledge.

`wiki` fixes this by maintaining a single vault per project. Ingest a document once; the knowledge is chunked, embedded, purpose-classified, and indexed. Future queries hit the vault instead of raw files. Entity linking deduplicates overlapping content automatically.

**Source = truth. `.wiki/` = derived knowledge.** Blow it away anytime; rebuild from source via `/reindex`.

## ⚡ Token savings

| Operation | Without wiki | With wiki |
|---|---|---|
| Answer a recurring question | Re-read files every time | Single `search_fulltext` call |
| Cross-topic synthesis | Manual grep + summarize | `search_by_tag` + reason traversal |
| Code file read | Full file in context | Structure map + targeted body load |

## ⚙️ How it works

```
source doc  →  ingest_thought / ingest_entity
                  ↓ OpenAI embed → purpose classification
            →  .wiki/thoughts/<uuid>.md   (type: thought, purpose: <tag>)
            →  .wiki/entities/<uuid>.md   (type: entity, purpose: <tag>)
            →  .wiki/reasons/<uuid>.md    (PartOf / Supports / ...)

.wiki/
  purposes/   — topical buckets (each has an embedding)
  thoughts/   — atomic facts from sources
  entities/   — recurring concepts
  reasons/    — directed edges between nodes
  questions/  — open questions
  conclusions/— synthesized knowledge
  ingest_log/ — audit trail
  .search/    — Tantivy full-text index
```

- **Purpose classification** — every doc is embedded and matched (cosine) against purpose embeddings. Top-1 above `WIKI_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` wins; below threshold → `general`.
- **Chunking** — multi-topic content splits into a parent container + child chunk docs linked via `PartOf` reasons.
- **Entity linking** — `learn_pass` / `link_doc` rewrites bare entity mentions as `[[wikilinks]]` and folds near-duplicate paragraphs into the canonical entity.

## 💿 Install

### Terminal

```bash
claude marketplace add yesitsfebreeze/wiki
claude plugin install wiki@yesitsfebreeze
```

### Inside Claude

```
/plugin marketplace add yesitsfebreeze/wiki
/plugin install wiki@yesitsfebreeze
```

Done. MCP server + skills + hooks installed automatically.

## 🏗️ Building

Requires Rust and the WASM target:
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
cargo install --git https://github.com/yesitsfebreeze/wiki
```

Installs `wiki` (or `wiki.exe`) into `~/.cargo/bin/`. Then add to `.mcp.json` manually if not using the plugin:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wiki": {
      "command": "wiki",
      "env": {
        "WIKI_PATH": ".wiki",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚙️ Environment

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `WIKI_PATH` | `./.wiki` | Vault root |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Required for ingest classification and reembed |
| `WIKI_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` | `0.35` | Cosine threshold; below → `general` purpose |
| `WIKI_DEDUPE_THRESHOLD` | `0.85` | Cosine threshold for paragraph deduplication in `learn_pass` |

Priority: env vars > hardcoded defaults.

## 🌐 Languages

`wiki` includes a WASM language system for code indexing. Each language is a `.wasm` module that teaches the parser how to decompose a source file into per-function bodies.

Language modules live in:
- `.wiki/code/languages/{ext}.wasm` — project-level
- `~/.config/split/languages/{ext}.wasm` — user-level
- embedded — built-in (`rs`, `py`)

Use the `list_languages` MCP tool to see what is installed in the current environment.
